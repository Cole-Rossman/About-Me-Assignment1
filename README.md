Deploy on Netlify. 
Define what content about yourself you want to include in this project.
Begin by changing the title element of the site to something that suits you.
Below, insert a body element to contain all the information and include the header element and then insert a h1 element for the main header display.
After your header, within the main element, create a p element which will hold the information about you, such as, name, pronouns, where you live, favorite animals list, and a fun fact.
Make an unordered list containing info about self
Create classes and ids within your html elements that can be targeted in the CSS files for styling changes. 
Within the CSS files include different styling for the background, body, header, and text (bold italic, etc.).
As you are creating the app, commit each step of the way to github.
When finished, pull request on github comparing dev to main and submit link.

## Making a plan

1. **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"**
1. **Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
1. **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?**
1. **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"**
1. **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change?**
1. **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done**
1. **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:

Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
Consider your data model.
What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need?
What are the key/value pairs?
What arrays might you need?
What needs to live in a persistence layer?
Is there some state we need to initialize?
Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be reused?)
