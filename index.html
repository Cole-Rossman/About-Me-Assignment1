            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello friends, my name is <span class="bold">Cole Rossman</span> and my pronouns are <span class="bold">he/him</span>. I would like to begin with welcoming everyone
                    to my website and hopefully you will gain some basic knowledge about me. I was born in North East Portland
                    and have lived in Oregon my entire life. I currently live in Lake Oswego, OR, <span class="font-size">however</span>, I plan on moving to
                    a different state upon being hired after my time at <span class="italics">Alchemy Coding Lab</span>. In my free time, I enjoy
                    lifting weights, spending time with my friends, trying new foods and as of recently, learning to code!
                </p>

                            From the ages <span class="font-size">10-14</span>, I would climb a different mountain every year with
                            my mom. Together, we climbed Mt. Hood, Mt. Saint Helens, Mt. Adams, Long's Peak, 
                            and South Sister.
